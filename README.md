# neural-style

- read https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/wiki/For-Beginners
- run neural-style with more GPUs to generate higher resolution pictures
- play with Multiple Style Images
- enlarge pictures throug AI tool
- The -init parameter is by default set to random, though from what I have seen, most people get better results by setting it to image.

# Training models
You can apply other neural networks as well, see https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/wiki/Using-Other-Neural-Models. If find that the standard model does not really do well on faces. This model in particular 'Rough_Faces by ProGamerGov' says that it improves the preservation of facial features. See here examples https://imgur.com/a/tArrY.

# High-res pictures
- use tiling to create high res pictures: https://github.com/ProGamerGov/Neural-Tile/
- Check this out to create high res pictures: https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/wiki/Techniques-For-Increasing-Image-Quality-Without-Buying-a-Better-GPU
- Check this script and how to increase the pic resolution: https://pastebin.com/YV4JC5Jn
- https://letsenhance.io/boost allows you to increase pic resolution size with very good results. This is a paid service though. You can run it yourself as well, see here https://medium.com/machine-learning-world/how-to-replicate-lets-enhance-service-without-even-coding-3b6b31b0fa2e
